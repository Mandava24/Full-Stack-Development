Objective
Build a Credit Card Management system (web application) which can handle the entire lifecycle of a customerâ€™s credit card. Functionality like adding and verifying credit card(s), fetching the credit card statement to generate a summary and extract insights and making payments for the card. The system should have a UI which gives the customers a clean interface to use.

How To Get Started
Clone the repository

cd backend and create a folder named config. Inside that folder make a file named config.json

Content of config.json should be similar to this.

Note: We are using mysql as a dialect(for storing data). You can use any dialect like Postgress, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. But you have to change config.json accordingly.

{
    "development": {
      "username": "<db_user>",
      "password": "<password>",
      "database": "cred_dev",
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "dialect": "mysql"
    },
    "test": {
      "username": "<db_user>",
      "password": "<password>",
      "database": "cred_test",
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "dialect": "mysql"
    },
    "production": {
      "username": "<db_user>",
      "password": "<password>",
      "database": "cred_prod",
      "host": "127.0.0.1",
      "dialect": "mysql"
    }
  }
In backend directory create a file named .env

Content of .env should be similar to this

PORT=5000
SECRET=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<YOUR_ENCRYPTION_KEY>
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID>
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN>
TWILIO_PHONE_NO=<TWILIO_PHONE_NO>
EMAIL=<AN_EMAIl_ID>
EMAIL_PAS=<EMAIL_PASSWORD>
In backend directory run npm install.

cd frontend and create a file named .env.

Content of .env should be similar to this.

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL_DEV=http://localhost:5000/
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL_PROD=<BACKEND_DEPLOYED_URL>
In frontend directory run npm install

cd backend and exectute following command

npm run dev - to run server and client concurrently
